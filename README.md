# DataStructure_Project
This project is the course project of 'CIE 205- Data structures and Algorithms Course'
It's the course offered in the 3rd year, Communication and information engineering program at University of Science and Technology, Zewail City, Egypt.

The project is mainly a GUI application to run a restaurant with the best Data Structures learned in the course:
 LinkedLists, Queues, Stacks, Trees and Graphs.
I used the SFML GUI Library, so the GUI cannot run without it.

In the university project discussion, I got the full mark + bonus points for implementing bonus techniques specified in the project docunment.
